## Early Morning Zombies

In 2012, my soccer team and I volunteered at the Honolulu Marathon for that year. This was an amazing experience where I was able to bond with my teammates and help my community at the same time. The manager of my soccer team, “Abunai” suggested we help out the community in some way. Volunteering at the Honolulu Marathon seemed like the perfect choice because we were all avid runners and we had the opportunity to be surrounded by other runners and other volunteers. The team was composed of twenty players, four coaches, and one manager. We all agreed to volunteer on that early morning of 2012. In order to help out with setting up the marathon, we had to wake up at 3am. My team and I were there by around 3:45 AM and we split up into groups of four where we either prepared water for the runners or helped set up tents and posters around the course. 

## Monumental Team

The team of four that I was assigned to originally helped set up tents and signs across the course, but later we were put on water duty. We were in charge of handing out the water to the oncoming runners during the marathon. Such a big project with hundreds of volunteers was hectic to say the least. Thankfully for us, there were great leaders in charge of assigning everyone a duty and ensuring that it was carried out. After this long morning, I learned a lot of valuable lessons. I learned that difficult, intimidating tasks are far more achievable with the help of a team. A monumental task can be conquered with a monumental team. I learned the importance of cooperation and effective communication. On that morning, we had to be very clear and concise with our words because things would likely be misheard in such a hectic environment.
