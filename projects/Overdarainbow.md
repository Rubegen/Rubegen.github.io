## Touch Grass (Project Overview)

Our Web application Over Da Rainbow tackles an emerging epidemic in a fun way. Our application can be used by students and staff in the University of Hawaii system who wish to explore the great outdoors. Going outside and getting your daily dose of Vitamin D is pivotal in mood and performance for all human beings. Most students would love to take a break from their assigments and enjoy the outside world for a while. The problem is that a large percentage of University of Hawaii students are from out of state.

## Recursive thinking

This project was tough to build because of the recursive component. With my limited knowledge of programming and of recursion, it had its challenges but I was able to create a program that solves any sudoku puzzle far faster than any human would be able to! I was the sole member of this project but I learned to use many different resources in order to solve small problems in my code. For example Youtube and StackOverflow were huge helps on my path to completing this project. Upon completion of my Sudoku Solver program, I can confidently say that my understanding of the concept of recursion improved greatly.
