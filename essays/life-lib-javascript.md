### Filet Mignon of Code
After being exposed to Javascript for about a week or two, I would choose to describe it as Java’s spoiled younger brother.  As a student who had only used Java prior to learning Javascript, I feel as if Javascript is just a better, beefed up version of Java. If Java is a bottom sirloin steak, then Javascript would be a filet mignon or a ribeye. Javascript was fairly easy to understand with some prior knowledge of programming. One of the biggest differences between Java and Javascript is the declaration of variable types. There is none of that in Javascript! You just declare a variable name and assign it whatever value you want. Compared to Java where you would have to declare what type of value that variable would be, like an int or a string for example. This feature seems very convenient for a programmer but could also be confusing for someone else reading your code. With that being said, I do believe that Javascript is a great language to use and develop in. After doing an introduction course on the language, I quickly grew to like it and found it very “user friendly”.

### Coding up a sweat
Athletic software engineering is an amazing concept! I wholeheartedly believe in this style of learning because coding is a skill just like any other and it is best learned through experience. Trial, error and lots of repetition. If you want to get in shape, a single twenty hour workout will not do you any good. But twenty different workouts, spread over a month, all an hour in duration and at high intensity would most definitely benefit you and your health. I believe the same principle applies here with athletic software engineering. The act of practicing something daily even if just for a few minutes can have a monumental impact on your abilities in the long run. Practice WODs are a great way to implement repetition and practice into your coding career. I have completed three WOD’s so far and I can already tell that they are extremely beneficial and effective at solidifying the topics in my head. I don’t find it stressful at all because there is nothing at stake. I feel free to make many mistakes during the exercise in order to minimize similar mistakes in the future. I have faith that implementing WODs into the athletic software engineering philosophy will prove to be beneficial in my career as a computer scientist.
