## Switch (majors)

My interest in software engineering began a long time ago. I was about six or seven years old when I coded my first infinite loop. By the age of twelve I had already designed my own physics based virtual reality free roam video game. And then I woke up. I was never a young coding prodigy. I made that story up (if you couldn’t tell). I was originally a business major when I registered at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. It was until the extended summer of 2020 where I came to the realization that being a business major would not be my thing. Although, I never thought coding and computer science would be my thing either. But after extensive research I conducted on YouTube, searching “highest paying jobs” I stumbled upon computer science. Sure there were other career options that could pay just as well or better than software engineering, but I liked the idea of being able to write code. I recognized it as a skill more than a talent, because unlike my fake story up there, no one pops out of the womb as a coding genius. 


## if (hard) {try harder};

It takes time and practice just like any other skill. Sure some people start out earlier than others, but I imagined that college could be an opportunity to learn something new and expand your horizons rather than sticking to what you already know. And so I took my first computer science class in my first year of college. It was very difficult at first. I could not seem to wrap my head around simple concepts! But the feeling of designing something from scratch was a very rewarding feeling. That feeling when I finish a project or an assignment after hours of despair, that's what keeps me going. I am currently a second year student and coding has not gotten easier. Everytime I understand a concept, a harder, more complex one appears before me. But just like any other skill or ability, it takes a lot of time and effort to build competency. And even more time and effort to build mastery of it.


## AI AI, Captain

As of right now, I really just want to learn as many programming languages as I can. I have only ever used Java and I am currently learning Javascript and C++. After building a strong foundation of programming languages and competency with object oriented programming, I hope to get an internship. I look forward to working together with others. Sharing my knowledge as well as learning from their expertise sounds like an awesome opportunity and amazing way to kickstart my career as a computer scientist. Later down the line, I am interested in learning about artificial intelligence. Things like Siri and Alexa which are now household names, are common forms of artificial intelligence. I am an avid user of both virtual assistants. Those two assistants help me out throughout my day, without my having to move a muscle. Artificial intelligence has made our lives easier thus far, but I believe we have only scratched the surface of the possibilities. The thought of creating something and equipping it with its own form of intelligence is quite fascinating in my opinion, and I hope to work on something similar in the future.
