## Overview

The problem: Many students come to the University of Hawaii for both the outstanding education and the breathtaking views and destinations. Oahu has a lot to offer its students from abroad with a plethora of views, eats, and memorable destinations . It is difficult however for a newcomer to become familiar with the island without any guidance or outlet.

The solution: This application will solve this problem by providing a hub for students in search of fun experiences or memorable locations. Hawaii is well known for being a tourist destination and there are many good restaurants and sites to visit. The application will provide destination ideas along with reviews, for users to find a place they are interested in.
