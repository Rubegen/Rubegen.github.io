## ICS 414 Fall '23 

In ICS 414, I embarked on a transformative journey that deepened my understanding of software development methodologies, expanded my technical skills, and honed my ability to work effectively in a team.

Embracing an issue driven software engineering process proved to be a pivotal aspect of our project success. By adopting this methodology, we fostered a dynamic development environment. While the robust and straight forward nature of issue driven development empowered our team to assign and tackle issues quickly, it also presented challenges in maintaining a steady pace of development.
GitHub served as the backbone of our entire project, facilitating seamless collaboration. Navigating GitHub issues became second nature as we utilized them for tracking tasks and addressing bugs. It streamlined our development workflow and also acted as the starting point of any operation. Getting back into the groove of branching and merging processes on GitHub was an often overlooked part of this semester. 

Integrating the systems while facilitating a smooth transition from Semantic UI to React Bootstrap for this project elevated my understanding of both frameworks as well as strengthened my software engineering repertoire. This experience instilled a sense of versatility in front-end development, which I believe will be invaluable in future projects. Collaborating with a diverse team of seven individuals provided both challenges and opportunities for growth. Effective communication and regular team meetings were essential to overcome coordination challenges. Learning to leverage the unique strengths of each team member and embracing a shared vision greatly contributed to our overall success. Managing time efficiently and meeting milestone goals emerged as critical skills throughout the semester. Meeting milestones not only ensured project progression but also built a sense of achievement and momentum within the team.

In conclusion, ICS 414 has equipped me with a comprehensive set of skills and experiences. The application of Agile methodologies, proficiency with GitHub, mastery of front-end frameworks, and the dynamics of teamwork have collectively shaped my growth as a software engineer.

## Acknowledgments 

Iâ€™d like to thank my team members for their hard work and collaboration throughout this project. Our success in this class would not have been possible without their dedication to the completion of this project. Special thanks to my instructor Carleton Moore who facilitated the class and provided an environment where students can take the lead and initiative when it comes to project completion, but will always be there to jump in and help if needed.
